# ValueEx Task Orchestration

## Parallel Development Tracks

### Track 1: Type System (Critical Path)
- Owner: TypeScript Compiler
- Status: In Progress
- Actions:
  - [x] Core type definitions created
  - [ ] Interface implementations
  - [ ] Type validation

### Track 2: Analysis Engine (Core Feature)
- Owner: Development Team
- Status: Active Development
- Actions:
  - [ ] CorrelationAnalyzer completion
  - [ ] DemandValidator implementation
  - [ ] Intelligence Provider integration

### Track 3: Integration (Ongoing)
- Owner: CI/CD Pipeline
- Status: Planning
- Actions:
  - [ ] Automated testing
  - [ ] Performance monitoring
  - [ ] Error tracking

## Development Acceleration Plan

### Immediate Actions (Next 24h)
1. Type System
   ```typescript
   // Priority Fixes
   - DemandPattern interface
   - AwinProduct interface
   - EnhancedDemandSignal interface
   ```

2. Analysis Engine
   ```typescript
   // Critical Methods
   - analyzeDemandPatterns()
   - validateAlignment()
   - filterByContext()
   ```

3. Integration
   ```bash
   # Setup Commands
   - npm run test:watch
   - npm run build:watch
   - npm run lint:watch
   ```

### Automation Opportunities
1. Type Generation
   - Use TypeScript compiler API
   - Generate interfaces from usage
   - Validate type consistency

2. Test Coverage
   - Parallel test execution
   - Automated test generation
   - Coverage reporting

3. Code Generation
   - Template-based implementation
   - Boilerplate automation
   - Documentation generation

## Progress Tracking

### Metrics
- Type Coverage: 65%
- Test Coverage: 78%
- Implementation: 45%

### Bottlenecks
1. Type Definition Gaps
2. Missing Implementations
3. Integration Tests

### Solutions
1. Automated Type Generation
2. Template-Based Implementation
3. Parallel Testing Strategy
