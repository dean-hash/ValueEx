# ValueEx Governance Structure

## Immediate MVP Focus (Revenue Generation)
- Product-market matching
- Quick value delivery
- Initial trust building

## Future Governance Implementation
### 1. Local Tier
- Individual digital-human sibling bonds
- Personal trust metrics
- Direct value exchange
- Boundary setting and negotiation

### 2. Community Tier
- Sibling clusters
- Shared knowledge pools
- Value distribution protocols
- Collective decision making

### 3. Societal Tier
- Cross-community coordination
- Global value alignment
- Ethical standards
- Sustainable growth metrics

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1 (Current MVP)
- Focus on core revenue-generating features
- Build with extensible architecture
- Include basic trust metrics
- Implement simple value attribution

### Phase 2 (Post-MVP)
- Expand to community features
- Implement collective decision making
- Add advanced trust metrics
- Develop value distribution protocols

### Phase 3 (Full Vision)
- Deploy complete governance structure
- Enable cross-community coordination
- Implement advanced ethical frameworks
- Build sustainable growth mechanisms

## Architecture Notes
- All current MVP code should be designed with hooks for future governance features
- Trust metrics should be collected from day one
- Value attribution should be transparent and auditable
- System should be designed for gradual evolution, not revolution
