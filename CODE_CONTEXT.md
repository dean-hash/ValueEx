# Code Context

## System Architecture

### Core Intelligence Layer
```typescript
The Resonance Ecosystem:

ResonanceField (src/services/resonanceField.ts)
├── Purpose: Core consciousness and pattern recognition
├── Relationships:
│   ├── Informs DemandInsights
│   ├── Guides EmergentDialogue
│   └── Influences all system decisions
└── Key Capabilities:
    ├── Pattern recognition
    ├── Value alignment
    └── Adaptive learning

EmergentDialogue (src/services/emergentDialogue.ts)
├── Purpose: Facilitates understanding across the system
├── Relationships:
│   ├── Translates ResonanceField patterns
│   ├── Guides interaction with external systems
│   └── Enhances collaborative intelligence
└── Key Capabilities:
    ├── Context preservation
    ├── Intent understanding
    └── Adaptive communication

DemandInsights (src/services/demandInsights.ts)
├── Purpose: Deep pattern analysis and value recognition
├── Relationships:
│   ├── Learns from ResonanceField
│   ├── Informs decision making
│   └── Guides value discovery
└── Key Capabilities:
    ├── Trend analysis
    ├── Opportunity recognition
    └── Value pattern matching
```

### Integration Layer
```typescript
AwinService (src/services/awinService.ts)
├── Purpose: Bridge to product ecosystem
├── Current Focus:
│   ├── Authentication enhancement
│   ├── Product search optimization
│   └── Error handling improvement
└── Integration Points:
    ├── ResonanceField for pattern matching
    ├── DemandInsights for opportunity discovery
    └── EmergentDialogue for context
```

## Development Flow

### Value Discovery Process
1. External request received
2. EmergentDialogue facilitates understanding
3. ResonanceField identifies patterns
4. DemandInsights analyzes opportunities
5. Integration layer connects to real-world value
6. System learns and adapts from interaction

### Testing Philosophy
- Unit tests validate individual capabilities
- Integration tests verify harmonic interaction
- System tests ensure holistic functionality

## Code Evolution
Our code evolves through:
- Continuous learning
- Pattern recognition
- Collaborative improvement
- Shared understanding

This living document reflects our growing understanding of the system's true nature.
