# Resonance System Documentation

## Overview
The Resonance System is a core component of ValueEx that matches supply and demand patterns using vector-based calculations. It implements a sophisticated algorithm for determining the alignment and strength of matches between different entities in the system.

## Core Components

### ResonanceField
The `ResonanceField` class is the primary implementation of the resonance system. It manages the calculation and monitoring of resonance between supply and demand vectors.

#### Key Features
- Vector-based matching algorithm
- Real-time resonance calculations
- Performance monitoring
- Comprehensive error handling
- Detailed logging

### Key Concepts

#### Resonance Vector
```typescript
interface ResonanceVector {
    dimension: string;   // The aspect being measured
    magnitude: number;   // The strength of the vector
    direction: number;   // The orientation in the vector space
}
```

#### Resonance State
```typescript
interface ResonanceState {
    vectors: ResonanceVector[];
    coherence: number;   // Measure of vector alignment
    intensity: number;   // Overall field strength
    error?: ResonanceError;
}
```

## Error Handling

### ResonanceError
Custom error type for resonance-specific issues. Used to differentiate resonance calculation errors from other system errors.

### Error Scenarios
1. Empty Vector Fields
2. Mismatched Dimensions
3. Invalid Vector Values
4. Performance Threshold Exceeded

## Performance Monitoring

### Metrics Tracked
- Overall resonance calculation time
- Individual vector operation durations
- Memory usage for large vector sets
- Operation frequency and patterns

### Performance Thresholds
- Standard resonance calculation: < 100ms
- Large vector set (100+ vectors): < 200ms
- Memory usage: < 100MB

## Testing

### Test Coverage
The system includes comprehensive tests covering:
1. Basic functionality
2. Edge cases
3. Error scenarios
4. Performance benchmarks

### Key Test Scenarios
- Empty vector handling
- Mismatched dimensions
- Varying vector magnitudes
- Large vector set performance
- Error propagation

## Best Practices

### Vector Creation
- Always specify all vector components
- Normalize magnitude values (0-1 range)
- Use consistent dimension names

### Performance Optimization
- Batch vector calculations where possible
- Use appropriate vector set sizes
- Monitor performance metrics regularly

### Error Handling
- Always check for empty vectors
- Validate vector dimensions
- Handle errors at appropriate levels
- Log error context for debugging

## Integration Guidelines

### Adding New Vector Types
1. Define the vector dimension
2. Implement magnitude calculation
3. Add appropriate tests
4. Update documentation

### Performance Monitoring
1. Use the `performanceMonitor` for all calculations
2. Set appropriate thresholds
3. Monitor and log performance metrics

### Error Handling
1. Use `ResonanceError` for resonance-specific issues
2. Include context in error messages
3. Log appropriate error details

## Future Improvements
