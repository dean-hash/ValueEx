# Development Notes

## Project Context
This project represents a collaborative effort to build ValueEx, an intelligent system for understanding and connecting supply and demand. The development process has been characterized by iterative improvements and continuous learning between human and AI collaboration.

## Key Components

### Awin API Integration
- Implementation of `AwinService` for product search and merchant data
- Authentication using API token and Publisher ID
- Careful handling of sensitive credentials through environment variables
- Current focus on resolving product search endpoint issues

### Core Services
- `resonanceField.ts`: Handles pattern matching between supply and demand
- `demandInsights.ts`: Analyzes and processes demand patterns
- `emergentDialogue.ts`: Manages interactive communication flow
- `intelligenceOrchestrator.ts`: Coordinates various intelligence services

## Development History

### Authentication and API Integration
- Initially implemented basic API token authentication
- Enhanced with Publisher ID in headers
- Iterative improvements to endpoint structure
- Current work on resolving 404 errors in product search

### Code Organization
- Modular service architecture
- Separation of concerns between different types of intelligence
- Strong typing with TypeScript
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Future Considerations
- Complete Awin API integration
- Add Fiverr API integration
- Enhance pattern matching algorithms
- Improve error handling and logging
- Add more comprehensive documentation

## Notes for Context Preservation
1. Each major component has its own service file with clear responsibilities
2. Configuration is centralized in `config/index.ts`
3. Test files mirror the structure of source files
4. Environment variables are documented in `.env.example`

## Critical Dependencies
- Node.js environment
- TypeScript for type safety
- Jest for testing
- Axios for HTTP requests
- Environment variables for configuration

This document will be continuously updated as the project evolves.
