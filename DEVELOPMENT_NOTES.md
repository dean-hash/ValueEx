- **EmergentDialogue**: Clear communication and understanding
- **DemandInsights**: Market opportunity identification

### Integration Points
- **AwinService**: Product and merchant discovery
- **Future Integrations**: Additional value networks

## Development Priorities
1. **Immediate Goals**
   - Robust API integration
   - Reliable product search
   - Effective value matching
   - Revenue generation

2. **Technical Excellence**
   - Clean, maintainable code
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Reliable performance
   - Secure operations

## Current Implementation
- Node.js/TypeScript for type safety
- Jest for testing
- Axios for API requests
- Environment variables for security

## Testing Focus
- API integration validation
- Search functionality
- Pattern matching accuracy
- Performance metrics

## Known Integration Issues

### Awin API Product Search (As of 2024-12-15)

**Status**: Blocked
**Component**: `src/services/awinService.ts`

The product search functionality is currently not working due to API access issues. While we can successfully access merchant data, attempts to fetch product data result in 404 errors.

#### Attempted Solutions:
1. Verified API credentials (token and publisher ID)
2. Tested different endpoint variations:
   - `/publishers/{publisherId}/product-search`
   - `/products/search`
   - `/product-search`
3. Confirmed authorization headers are being sent correctly

#### Next Steps:
1. Review latest Awin API documentation for correct product search endpoints
2. Investigate if additional API permissions are needed
3. Consider contacting Awin support for guidance

#### Impact:
- Product search and recommendation features are temporarily disabled
- Merchant integration remains functional

## Next Steps
1. Complete Awin API integration
2. Implement product search
3. Deploy initial version
4. Monitor and optimize performance
