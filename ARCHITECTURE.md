# ValueEx MVP Architecture

## Overview

ValueEx is an intelligent value optimization platform that leverages digital intelligence to maximize revenue through domain management, affiliate partnerships, and automated optimization strategies.

## Core Components

### 1. Digital Intelligence Layer (`src/core/intelligence/`)

The intelligence layer forms the cognitive backbone of ValueEx:

* `digitalIntelligence.ts`: Core decision-making engine
* `flowEngine.ts`: Orchestrates value flow optimization
* `autonomy.ts`: Self-improving optimization capabilities
* `trustNetwork.ts`: Builds and maintains trust relationships
* `valueFlow.ts`: Manages value stream optimization

### 2. Revenue Generation (`src/services/revenue/`)

Handles all revenue-related operations:

* `revenueTracker.ts`: Tracks and analyzes revenue streams
* `revenueActions.ts`: Executes revenue-generating actions
* `revenueStreamManager.ts`: Manages multiple revenue sources
* `domainAnalyzer.ts`: Analyzes domain value and potential

### 3. Affiliate Integration (`src/services/affiliate/`)

Manages affiliate network relationships:

* `awinService.ts`: Awin network integration
* `fiverrAffiliate.ts`: Fiverr affiliate program integration
* `opportunityMatcher.ts`: Matches domains with affiliate opportunities
* `affiliateManager.ts`: Coordinates across affiliate networks

### 4. Domain Management (`src/services/domain/`)

Handles domain portfolio optimization:

* `domainAnalyzer.ts`: Domain value assessment
* `portfolioAnalyzer.ts`: Portfolio-wide optimization
* `domainSetupManager.ts`: Automated domain configuration

### 5. Monitoring & Analytics (`src/services/monitoring/`)

Ensures system health and performance:

* `resourceMonitor.ts`: System resource monitoring
* `apiMonitor.ts`: API health tracking
* `metricsCollector.ts`: Performance metrics gathering
* `adaptiveThresholds.ts`: Dynamic performance optimization

## Data Flow

1. Domain Portfolio Analysis
   * Scan domain portfolio
   * Analyze value potential
   * Identify optimization opportunities

2. Affiliate Matching
   * Match domains with affiliate programs
   * Optimize affiliate link placement
   * Track conversion rates

3. Revenue Optimization
   * Monitor revenue streams
   * Identify underperforming assets
   * Implement optimization strategies

4. Performance Monitoring
   * Track system health
   * Monitor API performance
   * Collect and analyze metrics

## Branch Strategy

* `main`: Stable development branch
* `production`: Production-ready code
* `cleanup-and-simplify`: Active development branch for MVP
* `feature/mvp-health-monitoring`: Health monitoring features
* `gh-pages`: Documentation and reporting

## Development Workflow

1. Feature Development
   * Create feature branch from `cleanup-and-simplify`
   * Implement and test feature
   * Submit PR to `cleanup-and-simplify`

2. Integration Testing
   * Merge to `cleanup-and-simplify`
   * Run integration tests
   * Verify metrics and monitoring

3. Production Deployment
   * Merge to `main`
   * Run final validation
   * Deploy to production

## Security & Configuration

* Environment variables managed via Azure Key Vault
* Automatic API key rotation
* Secure credential storage
* Regular security audits
