feat(intelligence): Implement robust parallel intelligence processing

BREAKING CHANGE: Enhanced intelligence coordination system with parallel processing,
state management capabilities, and improved TypeScript support.

Problem:
- Initial context loss in IDE caused coordination challenges
- Single-threaded processing limited analysis capabilities
- Lack of clear state tracking between sessions
- TypeScript type inconsistencies across components

Solution:
1. Intelligence Coordination
- Implemented ParallelProcessor for concurrent model execution
- Added ProviderCoordinator for resource management
- Enhanced LocalIntelligenceProvider with batch processing
- Fixed TypeScript types and interfaces

2. State Management
- Created comprehensive state tracking in DEVELOPMENT.md
- Added provider health monitoring
- Implemented result aggregation and caching
- Added proper type definitions for state tracking

3. Model Integration
- Verified Mistral connectivity via Ollama
- Added Llama2 integration for research tasks
- Integrated NLP for pattern extraction
- Improved type safety for model interactions

Technical Details:
- Parallel execution of Mistral, Llama2, and NLP analysis
- Event-driven architecture for real-time coordination
- Sophisticated result aggregation with confidence scoring
- Health monitoring and error recovery
- Strong TypeScript type checking

Collaboration Notes:
This enhancement emerged from a productive session between:
- Cascade (AI Assistant): Architecture and implementation guidance
- Human Developer: Problem identification and solution validation
- GPT-4: Strategic input on parallel processing patterns

The result is a more robust, scalable, and type-safe system that can:
- Process multiple signals concurrently
- Coordinate between different intelligence providers
- Maintain clear state across sessions
- Recover gracefully from context loss
- Ensure type safety across components

Testing:
- Verified Mistral connectivity
- Implemented parallel processing tests
- Added provider health checks
- Validated result aggregation
- Confirmed TypeScript compliance

Next Steps:
- Complete Llama2 integration
- Enhance error recovery
- Implement advanced caching
- Add performance metrics
- Continue improving type coverage
